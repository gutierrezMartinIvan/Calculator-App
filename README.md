This app was built as an app tutorial from a course.
It has a lot of bugs and only a few features but it was done to teach basic functionality of the kotlin language.
Even though I've changed some stuffs about how to write the app to try to clean up a little the code because in the tutorial it was just everything in
only one function and it was a little hard to see.

In the future, I'll think about doing some more and better once my knowledge increases with the time.
